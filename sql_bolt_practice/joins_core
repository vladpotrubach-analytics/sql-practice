-- Goal: Rank movies by rating by combining descriptive and performance data.
-- What I did: Joined `movies` with `boxoffice` on movie_id and sorted by rating (DESC).
-- Business question: Which items (movies/products) are top-performing and should be prioritized/promoted?

SELECT
  title,
  rating
FROM movies
JOIN boxoffice
  ON movies.id = boxoffice.movie_id
ORDER BY rating DESC;
